## Term Project 1
Implement a simple DBMS that performs basic functionalities in SQL

### Project 1-1: SQL Parser
Parse and interpret SQL queries using the `Lark` library

- **`grammar.lark`**  
  - This file defines SQL grammar in EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) format. By leveraging the Lark API, this file allows the parsing of SQL queries and conversion of the results into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **`run.py`** 
  - `Lark` and `Transformer` classes are imported from the Lark library. A parser is created based on the grammar defined in the `grammar.lark` file using the `Lark` class, and a custom `SQLTransformer` class is created by inheriting the `Transformer` class. This `SQLTransformer` processes one AST generated by the parser.
  - When the AST of a query is received, the `SQLTransformer` class searches for the corresponding syntax and executes user-defined actions. Users can input SQL queries, and the parser accurately interprets the queries to print the requested query type. If a query is not entered using the correct syntax, a syntax error will be printed.

example:
```
DB_2018-17119> insert into account values(9732, 'Perryridge'); show tables; insert into account; desc account; 
DB_2018-17119> 'INSERT' requested 
DB_2018-17119> 'SHOW TABLES' requested 
DB_2018-17119> Syntax error
```
